# Fourier-Transform-And-Convolution
This project focuses on understanding the frequency domain through practical manipulations on sounds and images. It includes implementing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on 1D and 2D signals, performing sound fast forward, and conducting image derivatives. These tasks provide hands-on experience in frequency analysis, signal processing, and image manipulation, enabling a deeper understanding of the frequency domain and its applications in sound and image processing.
